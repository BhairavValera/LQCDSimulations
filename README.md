# Lattice-Quantum-Chromodynamics-Simulations
Suite of numerical simulation code for Lattice QCD simulations (Computational High Energy Physics).

A more robust [findBounce.py](Lattice-Quantum-Chromodynamics-Simulations/findBounce.py) will be pushed withing the next few months.

[QuarticPotential.py](Lattice-Quantum-Chromodynamics-Simulations/QuarticPotential.py) requires refactoring.
