# Lattice-Quantum-Chromodynamics-Simulations
Suite of numerical simulation code for Lattice QCD simulations (Computational High Energy Physics).

A more robust [findBounce.py](https://github.com/BhairavValera/Lattice-Quantum-Chromodynamics-Simulations/blob/master/findBounce.py) will be pushed withing the next few months.

[QuarticPotential.py](https://github.com/BhairavValera/Lattice-Quantum-Chromodynamics-Simulations/blob/master/QuarticPotential.py) requires refactoring.

Further updates soon.
